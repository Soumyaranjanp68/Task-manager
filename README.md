# Task Management API

This repository contains a RESTful API for managing tasks. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. It also includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints.

## Features

The API includes the following features:

1. **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and receive a JSON Web Token (JWT) for subsequent API requests.

2. **Task CRUD Operations:** Users can perform CRUD operations on tasks. They can create new tasks, retrieve a list of tasks, update existing tasks, and delete tasks.

3. **Task Filtering and Sorting:** Endpoints are provided to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria, such as task status, priority, due date, or assignee.

4. **User Roles and Permissions:** Role-based authorization is implemented, allowing different users to have different levels of access and permissions to tasks. For example, only the task creator or assigned user can update or delete a task.

5. **User Profile:** APIs are available for users to view and update their profiles, including features like changing passwords or updating personal information.

6. **Error Handling and Validation:** Proper error handling and validation of request data are implemented to provide meaningful error messages and maintain data integrity.

7. **Pagination and Limiting:** The API supports pagination in the API responses to limit the number of tasks returned per request. This enables users to navigate through larger sets of data.

8. **API Documentation:** Comprehensive API documentation is generated using tools like Swagger or Postman. The documentation describes the endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

9. **Testing and Deployment:** Unit tests are written for critical functionalities. The API can be deployed to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS for demonstration purposes.

10. **Logging and Monitoring:** Logging and monitoring mechanisms are implemented to track API usage, detect errors, and monitor performance metrics.
